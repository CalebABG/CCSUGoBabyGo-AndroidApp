App Improvements/ToDo's:

-Add portrait/screen-rotation lock
-Optimize string interpolation: make a global 'unit's' variable, set each sensor textview.'text' property to the variable
    - then on click handler for sensor Switch component, update the unit's variable, then set
    - each sensor textview.'text' property to the updated variable
-Add visual components for keep-alive boolean (safety check on incoming data from Arduino
    - send a 0x01 to Arduino as long as the connection is alive,
    - on Arduino side:
        - in the isr, check if the keep-alive value is == 0x01, else send stop command to motors
            - if connection is still alive, echo to the app that the emergency stop was called
        - in the main loop, perform same check (update volatile byte variable) if the transferred
            - byte was 0x01, then set volatile variable to true, else set to false
-Add visual for petal position (possible graphic or Switch component)
-Add visual for gear shift ()
-Add visual for steering position (angle <180 - 0 || 0 - 180>)
-Add onSensorChange handler for sending sensor values to Arduino
    - map the values for the x [-11 -> 11] and for the y [
